                <b>Source Code Improvements</b>
                <div>
                    Version 0.3 introduces a new toolkit called DTK (dred toolkit) which is designed for light weight, traditional desktop
                    applications. Benefits of this toolkit include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Small a light weight.</li>
                        <li>Easy to compile. The entire source code for DTK is compiled as a single translation unit (dtk.c) and requires linking
                            to only necessary platform-specific libraries such as GTK.
                        </li>
                        <li>Written entirely in C.</li>
                        <li>Improved control/widget and event handling infrastructure.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Windows are treated just like any other control and are no longer special entities.</li>
                                <li>Events are now handled through a central event queue rather than callbacks.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Improved painting performance.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Controls can be redrawn immediately or scheduled for later. Scheduling redraws improves performance because
                                    it gives the toolkit an opportunity batch drawing.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Painting on GTK has been improved. Previously, painting was done to an intermediary surface and then copied
                                    onto the window. The toolkit will now draw directly to the window. This also saves on a bit of memory.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Many more features and improvements are in the pipline for DTK, including common controls, better high DPI
                    support, drag-and-drop, and much more.
