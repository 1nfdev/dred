Building
========
To compile dred, simply compile the dred_main.c source file.

Options
=======
#define DRED_USE_EXTERNAL_REPOS
    For use internally by developers of dred itself. This option is used to #include external dependencies
    from their own repositories rather than the "external" directory. The purpose of this option is to 
    reduce the chance of accidentally editing the wrong file when changes to external dependencies are
    needed.
