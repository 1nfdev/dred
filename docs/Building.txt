Building
========

Compiling this on Linux requires the development version of the GTK+ 3.0 library and all associated
libraries (glib, gdk, atk, cairo, ...).

To compile dred on Linux use the following command:

    cc dred_main.c -lm -lrt -ldl `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0 glib-2.0`

Options
=======
#define DRED_USE_EXTERNAL_REPOS
    For use internally by developers of dred itself. This option is used to #include external dependencies
    from their own repositories rather than the "external" directory. The purpose of this option is to 
    reduce the chance of accidentally editing the wrong file when changes to external dependencies are
    needed.
